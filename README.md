"# softnioProject" 

The project is built on HTML, CSS, and a bit of jQuery. I have used the Bootstrap framework for the entire project. The Bootstrap container class has been used to make the website responsive. To find the mobile view, the maximum width of the device has to be 767px; tablet view is available from 768-991px. the website is live at https://kaiumr.github.io/softnioProject/ 


I have learned a lot after doing this project, and I enjoyed it during the whole period. The most difficult part of this project was content collection. I had to spend a good amount of time to collect project content. There was not much room to change the design; however, the design for tablet devices isn't precisely mentioned in the Figma file, so you might not find the design as you expected for tablet devices. It was a good few days with this project, but I am not satisfied with my output; there is a long way to go.
